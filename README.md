# Description
 A microscopic terminal utility that takes in a character and returns their ASCII code. I wanted to make something vaguely in the realm of usefullness, so I made this. 

 # Usage:
* Run the utility.
* Type a character.
* Press enter or return.
* Recieve the ACII code for said character.
